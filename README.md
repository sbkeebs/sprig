Astra Tanuki 2024

10 columns in a modified Katana layout.

This repo should contain:
- KiCAD 8 files for the PCB
- production files (gerbers, JLC BOM, CPL, etc) -- definitely double check the part numbers/availability before committing to fabrication! 
- a .stl for the case
- firmware in both qmk/vial and zmk, and source for each
